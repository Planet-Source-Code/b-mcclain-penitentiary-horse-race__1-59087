### Description

VERY SIMPLE GAME (BEGINNER LEVEL). This is the first game ive ever done. It's a game I learned while doing a 9 year sentence. You have a deck of cards (minus the aces - these are your 'horses') and you go through the deck flipping cards. Whatever suit you flip, that's which 'horse' you move. Whichever horse makes it past the finish line first wins. This game is usually bet on (JUST LIKE THE HORSE TRACK).
